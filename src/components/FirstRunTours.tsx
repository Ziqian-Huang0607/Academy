// FirstRunTours.tsx — the two tutorials every first-time user is walked through.
//
// 1. AccessGuide  — on /login, before anyone is signed in. Getting into
//    Synonance is the hard part: it needs a Launchpad account that has been
//    verified *on campus* as SHSID, and nothing on the sign-in card says so.
//    This is the same path the IDX "How to access Synonance" video walks
//    through, step by step. Shown once per browser.
// 2. AppTour      — the first time an account reaches a course page after
//    setup. Points at each item in the rail. Shown once per account.
//
// Both are forced (see ForcedTutorial): no skip, no close, finish to continue.

          courses, read the course notes, practise from the question base and sit mock tests.
